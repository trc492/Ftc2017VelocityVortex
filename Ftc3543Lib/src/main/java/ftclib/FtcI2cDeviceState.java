/**
 * This class provides methods to disable/enable the I2c device. The number of active I2C devices in the system
 * greatly affects the performance of other sensors. Most of the I2C sensors are not in-use until they are needed.
 * By disabling the unused sensors and only enabling them when needed will greatly improve the performance of
 * other sensors. Note that this class only works with the older I2cControllerPortDevice. The newer I2c devices
 * that use the I2cDeviceSynch implementation will not work because the methods required to disable/enable the
 * device (i.e. engage, disengage) are "protected" so this class cannot access them unless it extends the
 * I2cDeviceSynchDevice class.
